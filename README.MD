# Budget

Budget is a personal finance app built with [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

The goal was to create a budgeting app where logging a new purchase was as fast as possible. I found other budgeting apps too tedious. They would take too long to load, the UI was cluttered, and logging required too much clicking.

So I built Budget (name subject to change lol). There's a giant "Log Purchase" button at the bottom of the page so you can get in and out.

## TODO

- [ ] Make back button from current budget page go to budget list page
- [ ] Improve transaction list UI in category dropdown
- [ ] Remove all breadcrumbs
- [ ] Copy over previous month's categories to current month
- [ ] when starting new month, optionally copy rollover unspent money from previous month (doesn't increase planned, but does make spent negative)
- [ ] make better savings fund category than everydollar
