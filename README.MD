# Budget<sup>*</sup>

Budget<sup>*</sup> is a in-and-out purchase logging app built with [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

The goal is to make the flow of opening the app and logging a purchase as fast as possible. I found other budgeting apps too tedious. They would take too long to load, there'd be a pop-up shilling you their premium offering, the UI was cluttered with features I didn't use, and logging required too many clicks.

So I built Budget (name subject to change lol). There's a giant "Log Purchase" button at the bottom of the page so you can get in and out.

## TODO

- [x] Make back button from current budget page go to budget list page
- [x] Improve transaction list UI in category dropdown
- [x] Remove all breadcrumbs
- [x] Copy over previous month's categories to current month
- [x] when starting new month, optionally copy rollover unspent money from previous month (doesn't increase planned, but does make spent negative)
- [ ] make better savings fund category than everydollar
- [ ] allow reordering categories
- [x] add income

<sup>*</sup>name pending
